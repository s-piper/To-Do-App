Taskmaster

## Description

The Taskmaster allows you to create and complete tasks with ease.  Details can be entered however it makes sense to you.  Once you've selected a priority you're task managing!  Uncompleted tasks will be color coded and arranged in a descending order of importance. Once completed a simple button click will remove the highlighted color and drop the task into your completed list.  Delete a task at any point.  Any actions taken will update the server.

Do the Needful

## Description

Do the Needful, Dothne, allows you to create and complete tasks with ease.  Details can be entered however it makes sense to you.  Once you've selected a priority you're task managing!  Uncompleted tasks will be color coded and arranged in a descending order of importance. Once finished a click of the dynamically created complete button will remove the priority highlight and drop the task into your completed list.  Delete a task at any point.  Any actions taken will update the server.
